# Space-Based Early Warning System

## Overview

Early detection is critical in wildfire response—every minute matters. By the time ground-based detection or aerial reconnaissance identifies a fire, precious time for containment has been lost. This work package designs and validates a space-based sensing and communication constellation that provides persistent, wide-area surveillance for wildfire detection and serves as the communication backbone for the entire FireForce VI system. The satellite constellation acts as the vigilant eyes in the sky, detecting thermal anomalies before they become catastrophic fires, alerting [[Mission Control]] and dispatching [[Scout Drone|Scout Drones]] via [[Fire Cloud]].

## The Challenge

Creating an effective space-based wildfire detection system requires:
- **Continuous Coverage:** 24/7 surveillance of high-risk areas without gaps
- **Rapid Detection:** Identifying fire signatures within minutes of ignition
- **Low False Positives:** Distinguishing actual fires from industrial heat sources, reflections, and other thermal anomalies
- **Real-Time Communication:** Low-latency data transmission to ground systems
- **Orbital Optimization:** Maximum coverage with minimal satellite assets
- **Edge Computing:** Onboard processing to reduce data bandwidth and improve response time
- **Resilience:** Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- **Cost Effectiveness:** Affordable design for sustainable operations

Traditional satellite systems either lack the temporal resolution (too infrequent revisits) or spatial resolution (too coarse) for effective wildfire early warning.
