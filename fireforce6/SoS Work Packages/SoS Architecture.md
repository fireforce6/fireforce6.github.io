# Formal System Architecture Model

## Overview

FireForce VI is not just a collection of componentsâ€”it's a carefully architected system-of-systems where [[Fire Satellite|satellites]], [[Scout Drone|drones]], [[AI Fire Warden|AI]], ground stations, and human commanders work in orchestrated harmony. The SoS Architecture work package creates the authoritative formal model of this complex system using the Ontological Modeling Language (OML), capturing everything from stakeholder needs to component behaviors, from mission scenarios to interface specifications. This model serves as the single source of truth, enabling automated analysis, code generation, verification, and traceability across the entire FireForce VI ecosystem. It is developed in the [[Dev Work Packages/Modeling Environment|Modeling Environment]] and validated through [[SoS Integration]].

## The Challenge

Architecting a system-of-systems like FireForce VI requires:
- **Comprehensive Modeling:** Capturing stakeholders, requirements, capabilities, and behaviors

- **Autonomous Behavior:** Modeling complex AI-driven decision-making and coordination
- **Requirements Traceability:** Linking needs to capabilities to implementations
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between system and subsystem responsibilities
- **Simulation Integration:** Generating code for digital twin validation
- **Continuous Verification:** Automated checking of architectural consistency

Traditional document-based systems engineering cannot provide the rigor, automation, and analysis capabilities needed for safety-critical autonomous systems at this scale.
