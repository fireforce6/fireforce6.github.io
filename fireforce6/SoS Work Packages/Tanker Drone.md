# Heavy-Lift Precision Suppression System

## Overview

While Scout Drones provide intelligence, Tanker Drones deliver the decisive action—precision fire suppression at scale. These heavy-lift autonomous aircraft represent the combat element of FireForce VI, capable of carrying 500+ liters of fire retardant and delivering it with surgical precision to critical fire control points. Operating autonomously with minimal human intervention, Tanker Drones must navigate challenging conditions, coordinate with scout platforms for targeting, and execute precision drops within ±5 meters—all while maintaining absolute safety near active fires with extreme heat, turbulence, and unpredictable conditions.
