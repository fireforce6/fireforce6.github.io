# Physics-Based Digital Twin Platform

## Overview

Testing FireForce VI in real wildfire conditions is dangerous, expensive, and impractical for validating thousands of scenarios. This work package creates a comprehensive physics-based simulation environment—similar to NVIDIA Omniverse—that enables complete system testing and validation in a virtual world that accurately mirrors real-world fire behavior, terrain, weather, and system interactions. This digital twin serves as the virtual proving ground for the entire FireForce VI ecosystem, enabling testing of [[Scout Drone|drones]], [[AI Fire Warden|AI coordination]], and [[Mission Control|command interfaces]] in realistic scenarios before deployment.

## The Challenge

Validating an autonomous firefighting system requires:
- Realistic fire behavior that matches actual wildfire physics
- Accurate terrain and environmental modeling at scale
- Real-time weather simulation with dynamic conditions
- Hardware-in-the-loop integration for physical components
- Support for hundreds of concurrent simulation scenarios
- Computational efficiency for interactive testing
- Repeatable scenarios for regression testing
- Edge case and extreme condition testing without risk

Real-world testing is limited, costly, and cannot safely explore failure modes or extreme scenarios that the system must handle.
