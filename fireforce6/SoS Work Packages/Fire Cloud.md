# Distributed Real-Time Coordination Platform

## Overview

FireForce VI is a system of systems with [[Fire Satellite|satellites]] in orbit, [[Scout Drone|drones]] in the air, ground stations, and [[Mission Control]]â€”all needing to communicate and coordinate in real-time. Fire Cloud is the distributed data fabric that makes this possible: a resilient, high-performance messaging and data fusion platform that ensures every component has the information it needs, when it needs it. Built on Data Distribution Service (DDS) principles using ROS2, Fire Cloud handles the chaos of wildfire operations where network links fail, drones go offline, and every millisecond matters.

## The Challenge

Coordinating a distributed autonomous system in wildfire conditions requires:
- **Ultra-Low Latency:** Sub-100ms message delivery for real-time coordination
- **High Reliability:** >99.9% message delivery despite challenging conditions
- **Network Resilience:** Automatic recovery from partitions and failures (<5 seconds)
- **Massive Scale:** Support for 1000+ endpoints (drones, sensors, services)
- **Heterogeneous Platforms:** Seamless communication across diverse systems
- **Graceful Degradation:** Maintain critical functions during partial failures
- **Quality of Service:** Different guarantees for different data types
- **Real-Time Fusion:** Merge sensor streams into coherent situational awareness

Traditional cloud architectures and message brokers cannot meet the latency, reliability, and autonomy requirements of safety-critical distributed systems operating in hostile environments.
