# Collaborative Ontological Modeling Platform

## Overview

Systems engineering at the scale of FireForce VI requires rigorous, formal modeling of system architectures, behaviors, and requirements. This work package delivers a cutting-edge web-based collaborative development environment for creating, editing, and analyzing system models using the Ontological Modeling Language (OML). The platform enables distributed teams to work together on complex system models with the same sophistication as modern software development environments. This environment is used to create the [[SoS Work Packages/SoS Architecture|SoS Architecture]] model and integrates with the [[Project Environment|Project Environment]] for traceability and the [[Testing Environment|Testing Environment]] for validation.

## The Challenge

Developing a sixth-generation autonomous firefighting system demands:
- Formal specification of system architectures across multiple domains
- Precise modeling of component interfaces and behaviors
- Traceability from requirements to implementation
- Collaborative editing by geographically distributed teams
- Visual comprehension of complex system relationships
- Rigorous analysis and validation of system properties
- Version control and configuration management for models

Traditional desktop modeling tools lack the collaboration features, cloud-native architecture, and analytical power needed for modern systems engineering at this scale.
