# AI-Powered Systems Engineering Assistant

## Overview

FireForce VI's complexity spans multiple domains, work packages, and thousands of engineering artifacts. Engineers need instant access to project knowledge and assistance with complex systems engineering workflows. This work package delivers an intelligent AI assistant that understands the entire FireForce VI ecosystem, answers questions in natural language, and actively assists with systems engineering tasks through pre-configured workflows integrated directly into development environments. It provides context-aware assistance for the [[Modeling Environment|Modeling Environment]], [[Project Environment|Project Environment]], and [[Testing Environment|Testing Environment]], with deep understanding of the [[SoS Work Packages/SoS Architecture|SoS Architecture]] and all system components.

## The Challenge

Modern systems engineering projects face critical knowledge management challenges:
- Information scattered across repositories, documents, models, and specifications
- Engineers spending hours searching for relevant context
- Steep learning curve for new team members
- Complex workflows requiring deep domain expertise
- Difficulty maintaining consistency across work packages
- Time-consuming manual tasks that could be automated
- Loss of institutional knowledge during team transitions

Traditional search tools and documentation systems cannot understand semantic relationships, reason about system architecture, or actively assist with engineering workflows.
