# **Project Overview**

Welcome to FireForce VI - an ambitious project that tackles one of California's most pressing challenges: the devastating impact of wildfires. With annual economic losses of $275B and over 2.3M acres burned yearly, traditional firefighting methods are struggling to keep pace with increasingly intense and unpredictable fires.

FireForce VI represents a revolutionary approach to wildfire combat through an innovative sixth-generation autonomous firefighting system (see [[Problem]] for crisis details and [[Inspiration]] for the aerospace-inspired vision). This system integrates:

- **Real-Time Intelligence:** Fusing satellite imagery, weather data, and terrain analysis into actionable insights within seconds
- **Autonomous Fleet Operations:** Coordinating dozens of drones across multiple fire zones with precision
- **AI-Driven Strategy:** Generating and executing adaptive suppression strategies that evolve with fire behavior
- **Human-Centric Design:** Maintaining human oversight while leveraging AI for tactical execution

This project will challenge you to apply [[Engineering Competencies|advanced systems engineering principles]] to create a solution that could save lives, protect communities, and revolutionize how we combat wildfires. Review the [[System Requirements]] to understand the technical scope, [[Success Criteria]] for stakeholder validation, and the [[Operational Scenario]] to see the system in action. Explore the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] for the complete project organization and the [[SoS Work Packages/Environment Simulation|Environment Simulation]] for our physics-based digital twin technology.
