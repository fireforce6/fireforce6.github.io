> **Validation Standard:** "The system must demonstrate clear superiority to current methods while maintaining absolute trust from fire service professionals and the communities they protect."

These criteria are validated through the [[Dev Work Packages/Testing Environment|Testing Environment]] and [[SoS Work Packages/Environment Simulation|Environment Simulation]] platforms. See [[Operational Scenario]] for how the system meets these requirements in practice, and [[System Requirements]] for the technical specifications that enable success.
